# PiCKeT – SA’s Legal Fencing App

One of the most common issues that the Flinders Legal Centre (FLC) deals with is fencing disputes, and the process can be complicated because relevant legal issues must be considered before the correct advice can be given to clients. This takes up a significant amount of the FLC’s time and resources, therefore this app is designed to analyse clients’ initial inquiries and direct them to the appropriate resources. As the app can be accessed from anywhere, including on mobile devices, it will improve the clients’ experience because they can access relevant information that is tailored to their needs anywhere, and at any time.
