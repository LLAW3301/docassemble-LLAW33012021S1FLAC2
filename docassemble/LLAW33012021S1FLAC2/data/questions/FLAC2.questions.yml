question: "I want to replace my fence with a new one even though the existing one is not broken"
subquestion: |
  By completing, signing and providing your neighbour with a Formal Notice, it allows you to obtain your neighbour's consent for the work and have them pay for half of the cost of the new fence.



  If you do not hear back from neighbour after 30 days since serving them with the Formal Notice, then your neighbour is deemed to have agreed to fencing work and it can begin.



  To legally force your neighbour to pay for half of the fencing costs, you must go through this Formal Notice process.
