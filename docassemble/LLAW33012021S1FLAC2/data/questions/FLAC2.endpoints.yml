question: "Informal Amicable Discussions"
subquestion: |
  Have you contacted your neighbour about the replacement? 

   

  It will not be necessary for you to proceed if you and your neighbour reach an agreement. Verbal agreements are useful. However, written agreements are preferable. 

   

  You may use this [Sample Fencing Agreement template](https://lawhandbook.sa.gov.au/ch31s02s01.php). 

   

  The Flinders Legal Centre can review your agreement before it is finalised. 

  You can book an appointment with them 
  [here](https://www.flinderslegalcentre.net.au/dir/home/appointments/).
